# ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales Analysis (1971-2024) ðŸš€

## Introduction

This project dives deep into the fascinating world of video game sales, offering insights into top-selling titles, sales trends, genre specialization by consoles, and regional popularity of games. By leveraging the power of DAX for advanced calculations and data exploration, this project aims to answer critical business questions in the video game industry.
## Project Overview
### Objectives
The primary goals of this project were to:
1. Identify the **top-selling video game titles worldwide**.
2. Determine the **year with the highest video game sales**.
3. Analyze **console specialization by genre**.
4. Explore the **regional popularity of video game titles**.
### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Dataset**: Pre-cleaned video game sales data (1971-2024)
- **Excel**: For data visualization and analysis
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) **: To perform complex calculations

## Key Analyses and Visualizations
### 1. Top-Selling Titles Worldwide
To showcase the best-selling video game titles, I created a **pie chart** highlighting the top three titles: **Call of Duty: Black Ops**, **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare**, and **Grand Theft Auto V**. This visualization helps in understanding which titles dominated the market and how they compare to other high-performing games.

### 2. Year with the Highest Sales
A **line chart** was utilized to visualize the trends in video game sales over the years. This chart makes it easy to spot the peak sales year and observe how sales have evolved over time.

### 3. Console Specialization by Genre
To analyze console specialization, I grouped consoles by the genres they support and used a **bar chart** to represent this data. The analysis revealed that the **Strategy** genre is supported by 37 different consoles, while **Action, Adventure, Puzzle, and Simulation** genres are each supported by just one console. This provides valuable insights into how different consoles are positioned in the market based on genre focus.

### 4. Regional Popularity of Titles
I compared the performance of video game titles across different regions by creating **tables** that clearly display where certain titles are popular and where they underperform. For example, **Grand Theft Auto V** is highly popular in **North America** but significantly underperforms in **Japan**. On the other hand, **Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars** has more balanced sales across regions, while **Grand Theft Auto** titles generally perform well in **Europe and Africa** but flop in Japan.

## Insights

- **Top-Selling Titles**: The top three best-selling video game titles worldwide are **Call of Duty: Black Ops**, **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare**, and **Grand Theft Auto V**.
- **Regional Popularity**: **Grand Theft Auto V** is a major hit in **North America** but struggles in **Japan**. Conversely, **Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars** shows balanced sales across regions. The **Grand Theft Auto** series is generally popular in **Europe and Africa** but flops in Japan.
- **Genre Specialization**: The **Strategy** genre is supported by the most consoles, with 37 different platforms offering strategy games. In contrast, **Action, Adventure, Puzzle, and Simulation** genres are each supported by only one console.
- **Top-Selling Genres**: **Sports** is the top-selling genre with total sales of **1,187.5 million units**, followed closely by **Action** with **1,125.8 million units** in sales.

## Key Takeaways

- The project highlighted the importance of data visualization in identifying trends and insights in the video game industry.
- DAX was instrumental in performing the complex calculations needed to derive deeper insights from the data.
## Conclusion

This project was not just an exercise in data analysis but a great learning experience in applying DAX for business intelligence. The insights derived from the analysis can be valuable for game developers, marketers, and industry analysts.
